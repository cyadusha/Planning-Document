The dataset that will be used is the books-crossing dataset which is already built into the `recommenderlabBX` package. This dataset will be converted into a data frame and then loaded into spark. Then, the alternating least squares factorization method will be used in 2 cases - first on the entire dataset and next on the entire data set split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). Then, for both cases, the predictions and the ratings will be averaged by item. Then, the items containing the top average predictions will be rendered. Additionally the root-mean-squared error, mean-absolute error, and the area under the curve will be computed for each case. 

The idea here is not only to get the top recommendations from each method but also to determine which method would deliver accurate predictions.
